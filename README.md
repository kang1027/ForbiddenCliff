# ForbiddenCliff_mobile

The Unity Flatformer game Forbidden Cliff, which was created in the second year of high school, was created by adding a mobile version + multi-function.<br>

#  Function
 I used photon server was designed to allow two players to compete in multiple ways.<br>
 In the second year of high school, the foundation itself was developed hard to maintain, so there are still many bugs left.
 
# design
The background of the map and the objects under the character are hand-made by the team's designer.
The scaffolding and the wall used Free Asset.

# Too-much
